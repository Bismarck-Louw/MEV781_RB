# MEV781_Tutorials

This is a repository for any MEV781 tutorials I write up in my spare time.

This page will simply consist of Jupyter notebook files that one can access and use.

The tutorials thus far are as follows:
1. The Fourier Transform
2. A basic explanation of Time Synchronous Averaging and Computed Order Tracking.

Tutorials I wish to add:
- A tutorial on the wavelet transform could be interesting.
- Perhaps another interesting tutorial on the Kurtogram and other Grams (will need to discuss with others).
- A tutorial on cyclostationarity would be awesome, but it would not be simple and I would not be able to do it alone.
