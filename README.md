# MEV781_Tutorials

This is a repository for any MEV781 tutorials I write up in my spare time.

This page will simply consist of Jupyter notebook files that one can access and use.

The tutorials thus far are as follows:
1. The Fourier Transform

Tutorials I wish to add:
- A tutorial on time synchronous averaging, the order domain and time-varying operating conditions may be a good idea. It may be good to take a toy signal and showcase how the problems arise.
- A tutorial on the wavelet transform could be interesting.
