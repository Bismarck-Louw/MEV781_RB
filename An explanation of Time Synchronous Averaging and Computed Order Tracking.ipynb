    "The purpose of this notebook is to detail some notes on the TSA and COT. I will not provide code to implement the methods but rather walk the student through the process with figures.\n",

    "Steps: \n",
    "- Detail how the tachometer and signal are related (visually)\n",
    "- Detail how we use the tachometer to extract rotations synchronous with the shaft\n",
    "- Discuss how we account for shaft speed changes and how we correlate the rotation indices in practice (different sampling rates)\n",
    "- Discuss relationship to COT and how COT provides us information with respect to shaft rotations\n",
