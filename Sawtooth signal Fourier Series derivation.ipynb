    "where it clear to see that we can now draw some conclusions for what we might see in the Fourier Transform. Firstly, we expect a DC offset of 0.5 as this is the coefficient of the signal at $n=0$. Secondly, we expect some visual decay in the magnitude as the frequency increases, as we are summing $n$ sinusoids at integer frequencies, where the amplitude of these sinusoids is given by $\\frac{1}{\\pi n}$. (If we look at the single-sided spectrum, we expect these terms to double). It is interesting to note that the FFT for $t_{end} = 1s$ is not the same as the analytical calculation, but this is fixed by setting $t_{end} = n, n = 2, 3, 4...$. It may have to do with the periodicity of the signals, as under 1 second we never show the signal the discontinuity."
