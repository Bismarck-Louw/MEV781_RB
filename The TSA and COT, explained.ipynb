    "The purpose of this explanation is to detail a high-level overview of the time-synchronous average (TSA) and Computed Order Tracking (COT). This will require a basic understanding of the objectives of TSA and COT, and I will try to provide some explanations and intuition to help those who do not have a good grasp on the concepts. At the end of each section, I provide a step-by-step guide for implementing these methods.\n",

    "The TSA and COT are two methods that are especially useful in vibration analysis. The TSA allows on to visualise the expected vibration signal from one rotation, while COT allows one to perform an order spectrum analysis on the order tracked signal to visualise the amplitude and/or the phase of the signal with respect to the shaft frequency. The TSA allows one to visualise how the vibration signal looks in one rotation and the averaging is necessary to reduce the effect of noise, which can easily interfere with any analyses we do in the time domain otherwise. COT allows us to identify signal components that are a direct function of the shaft speed, which is useful for identifying mesh frequencies or bearing faults, as these are a function of the shaft speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, some of you may be wondering: Why are the TSA and COT included in the same section of discussion? Aren't these completely different ideas? To a certain degree, yes, these techniques are quite different. However, in implementation, they share several similar elements and only differ in the latter stages of the implementation. I prefer to think of TSA as a per revolution average of a COT signal. However, we will not focus on this right now, but I will try to allude to this fact at the end of this write-up. "

In this example, we can assume that $F_{sinusoid} = F_{shaft}$ for simplicity. Thus,  this implies that $N_r = 100$ (as it takes 1 second to complete a rotation and the signal is 100 seconds long) and $N_s = F_s$. "

    "_However_, there is a problem here. If the shaft speed is varying or there is perhaps some natural speed drift or jitter, we are not guaranteed to have the same number of points in the rotation segments. This implies that $N_s$ may not be consistent for each of the $N_r$ segments, which is a different problem to asynchronous averaging.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what do we do? The simplest solution is to perform linear interpolation for a set number  of samples $N_s$ for each rotation, thereby ensuring that we ensure that there are a consistent number of samples for each segment that is representative of a shaft rotation. This process will ensure that we can efficiently determine the TSA of a signal.\n",

    "\n",
    "The reason for this is: a tachometer is not always guaranteed to be the sampled at the signal sampling rate, thus the array indices of the pulse point may not align between the vibration signal and the tachometer signal. In this case, we need to determine the rotation start and end points using time values, which is simple, and then find the corresponding array index from the vibration signal. *I feel that it is important to be wary of this if you use the TSA in future.*"

We can think of this in a practical setting as a signal that comes from a machine with a linearly increasing shaft speed and provides an indication of when the tachometer is pulsing. It is simple enough to recreate this signal and process, so let us do exactly that. I will consider a signal with a linearly increasing frequency between $1Hz$ and $5Hz$ for a time of 10 $seconds$.
